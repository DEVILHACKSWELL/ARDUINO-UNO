/* 
Steps:
Attach a push button on breadboard and a wire from button's right leg to the negative row of breadboard then another wire from negative row to the digital GND 
attach a resistor with its one leg in negative row of breadboard and other to a column in breadboard, then a led with its cathode(-ve) i.e its shorter leg in the column of the resistor in the breadboard
Then a wire from anode(+ve) longer leg of led to the 13 pin digital . Then add a wire from button's top left leg to the digital pin  .

// this constant won't change:
const int buttonPin = 2;
const int ledPin = 13;

// Variables will change:

int buttonState = 0;
int lastButtonState = 0;
int buttonPushCounter = 0;
void setup() {
  // initialize the button pin as a input:
  pinMode (buttonPin, INPUT_PULLUP);
  // initialize the LED as an output:
  pinMode (ledPin, OUTPUT);

}


void loop() {
  // read the pushbutton input pin:
  buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);

  //compare the buttonState to its previous state  
  if (buttonState != lastButtonState) {
    // if the state has changed, increment the counter
    if (buttonState == LOW) {
      // if the current state is LOW than the button
      // wend from off to on:
      buttonPushCounter++;

      //Delay a little bit to avoid bouncing
      delay(5);
    }
    // save the current state as the last state,
    //for next time through the loop
    lastButtonState = buttonState;


    // turns on the LED every other button push button
    // checking the modulo of the button push counter.
    // the modulo function gives you the remainder of
    // the division of two numbers:
    if (buttonPushCounter % 2 == 0) {
      digitalWrite (ledPin, HIGH);
    } else {
      digitalWrite (ledPin, LOW);
    }
  }
