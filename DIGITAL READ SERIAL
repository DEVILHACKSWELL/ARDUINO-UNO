  DigitalReadSerial

  Reads a digital input on pin 2, prints the result to the Serial Monitor

Requirements- arduino uno , resistor , push button and wires 
Steps:attach push button to the board ,resistor to its right leg, cable to resistor right leg to the negative of breadboard and then that negative of breadboard to the GND of power using another cable
 attach cable from button's left leg to the positive of breadboard and then it to the power +5V using another cable.
  another cable from buttons top right leg to the digital 2 pin on the arduino board.

// digital pin 2 has a pushbutton attached to it. Give it a name:
int pushButton = 2;

// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {
  // initialize serial communication at 9600 bits per second:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  // make the pushbutton's pin an input:
  pinMode(pushButton, INPUT);
}

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop() {
  // read the input pin:
  int buttonState = digitalRead(pushButton);
  // print out the state of the button:
  Serial.println(buttonState);
  delay(1);  // delay in between reads for stability
}
