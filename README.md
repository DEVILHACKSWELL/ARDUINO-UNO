In this Repository, am going to save the code that is used on ARDUINO UNO for performing basic ARDUINO UNO projects using some additional things along with Arduino UNO . 
This code can be put in the arduino using the arduino IDE or simply Arduino INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT.
Most of this code that am going to use is uploaded into arduino using Arduino IDE 2.3.1-nightly-20240212
